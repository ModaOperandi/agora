# React

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is Facebook's UI library for creating dynamic, quickly modified UI trees based on
Javascript. It is easily the most popular Frontend UI/component library currently in use, with a rich toolset and
powerful set of suggested patterns based in functional composition and immutability. Given its simplicity and purity
with regards to staying true to functional Javascript, it is also easily hackable, resulting in a large community
of packages for creating "true to form" libraries that complement React's core feature set well.

## Why?

A single UI library will help Moda reuse a larger amount of UI styling and functionality, as well as allow
a building up of expertise and knowledge within a more unified skill set across the engineering team.

## Drawbacks

React's primary drawback is a multitude of choices, in libraries and code patterns, means that two groups
both developing Frontend code on React can still end up with drastically different looking codebases.
The only way to honestly guard against this is developer awareness, and similar linting rules and dependency sets.

## Positives

React's philosophy of treating UI's as a dynamically generated tree of functionally composable elements
of style, functionality, and output, represents a very strong foundation with which to build frontends
applications. The availability of packages for streamlining separation of concerns is spectacular, and
React itself makes no assumptions about the context in which it runs as well.
