### ReasonML

[ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/) is an alternative syntax to [OCaml](http://www.ocaml.org/) - a language that features functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming with a compiler that employs static typing and type inference. It was founded by the creator of ReactJS, [Jordan Walke](https://github.com/jordwalke), with the backing of Facebook, Bloomberg, and other individual contributors within the open source community.
