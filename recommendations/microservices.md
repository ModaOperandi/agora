Moda is opportunistically moving functionality out of its Rails monolith (Mojo) and into microservices.

# Languages & Frameworks

## Assess

### http4s

_TODO: Summary of the details below._

### Kotlin

Kotlin is increasingly being considered as a viable language option for microservices. Moda Tech should keep an eye on it as a "better Java" if functional programming is not a priority. Moving Kotlin out of Assess would require a strong estimate of the level of investment to support it at the platform level.

## Trial

### Play

Battle-tested HTTP / MVC framework that is the industry go-to for Scala development; supports Futures and Akka.

### Scala

Scala is a more-mature modern language that gives Moda Tech an approachable entry to functional programming. It enjoys widespread adoption and many library options for HTTP frameworks, testing, actors, etc.
