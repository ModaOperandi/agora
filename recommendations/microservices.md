### Kotlin vs Scala

This section provides Kotlin vs Scala selection information in brief. Here's a good lecture with comparison overview: [Kotlin vs Scala](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsMejigb1Zk) 

### Kotlin

Here are some lectures from Google I/O to get some idea about Kotlin:

[Introduction to Kotlin (Google I/O '17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1RVYt2QKQE)

[How to Kotlin - from the Lead Kotlin Language Designer (Google I/O '18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P20npkvcb8) 

Here are main arguments/advantages of Kotlin over Scala

1. Kotlin design is simpler then Scala design - allowing flatter learning curve.

2. Kotlin has high level of interop with Java:

    * Existing battle-checked Java frameworks can be leveraged directly from Kotlin.

    * Code written in Kotlin can be used directly from Java. Less risky to introduce Kotlin with an option to go back to Java at any moment.

    * Existing codebase in Java could be converted to Kotlin at almost zero cost (even with one click in IntelliJ IDEA).

    * Easy to adopt at other areas, like QA automation.

3. Kotlin is one of two (golang as well) industrial languages that have coroutines.

4. Kotlin is multiplatform (implemented by vendor) - could be used for wide variety of tasks even where heavy JVM is not applicable.

5. Kotlin outside of Android is pretty fresh - should help to get the attention of talented engineers and define Moda Operandi as a technology driven company.

6. Kotlin is newest in JVM space - it has opportunity for developers to make an impact by contributing more in open source.
