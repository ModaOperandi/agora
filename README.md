# Moda Operandi Engineering Standards

Please view the [full Radar](https://radar.thoughtworks.com/?sheetId=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FModaOperandi%2Fstandards%2Fmaster%2Fcsv%2Fall.csv) or [invididual subsections](recommendations).

## Contributing
After adding new items, please run [bin/make-csvs.sh](bin/make-csvs.sh) locally and commit the resultant CSVs. You will need Python installed locally.

If you want to view changes to the radar but have pushed a PR to a non-master branch, simply edit the radar url to use `your-branch-name` instead of `master`. Be warned that the raw csv gets cached by Github for an indeterminate amount of time, so don't push new commits and expect to immediately see changes.
