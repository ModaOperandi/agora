Current thinking is that it is superior to <a href="#cloudformation">CloudFormation</a> for the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Terraform is multi-service. This does not mean that the same Terraform resource can be deployed indiscriminately across different clouds. But it does mean that resources across multiple cloud providers (or any provider, really) can be captured in Terraform - and thus be captured in the same workflow, pipelines, etc.</li>
<li>Terraform uses the provider's APIs. As a result, Terraform - which can model anything available via the API - will always be ahead of CloudFormation in supported resources.</li>
