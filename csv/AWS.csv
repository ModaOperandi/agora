The general idea is to reduce friction by bringing IaC to where the developers live, i.e. in the same language and with the same constructs (coding constructs, dependency management, importing libraries, etc) within they are accustomed to working.</p>

<p>This is an interesting space with some industry attention devoted to it and it might make sense to do some work to prove it out.</p>
