"Artifactory","Adopt","Tools",FALSE,"<p>Defacto industry standard for providing multiple different package repositories (npm, Maven, Docker, etc).</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/ModaOperandi/agora/blob/master/recommendations/details/packages.md"">Details</a></p>"
"React","Adopt","Languages & Frameworks",FALSE,"<p>The most popular Frontend UI/component library currently in use, with a rich toolset and powerful set of suggested patterns based in functional composition and immutability. React's philosophy of treating UI's as a dynamically generated tree of functionally composable elements of style, functionality, and output, represents a very strong foundation with which to build frontend applications.</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/ModaOperandi/agora/blob/master/recommendations/details/react.md"">Details</a></p>"
"Terraform","Trial","Tools",FALSE,"<p>Terraform is the current best-in-class <a href=""https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/what-is-infrastructure-as-code"">infrastructure-as-code</a>) provider, providing (among other things) a multi-service approach through the ""front door"" of provider APIs that is actively developed both via core HashiCorp support and the open source community.</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/ModaOperandi/agora/blob/master/recommendations/details/terraform.md"">Details</a></p>"
"TypeScript","Trial","Languages & Frameworks",FALSE,"<p>Typescript has immense support, fantastic tutorials, and valid JS is, if not lint-passing, valid TS. As such, the learning curve should be quite minimal. It is created by Microsoft as a compile-time-typed alternative to Javascript, with a large community of tooling and cross-mixing with existing JS libraries.</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/ModaOperandi/agora/blob/master/recommendations/details/typescript.md"">Details</a></p>"
"Scala","Trial","Languages & Frameworks",FALSE,"<p>Scala is a more-mature modern language that gives Moda Tech an approachable entry to functional programming. It enjoys widespread adoption and many library options for HTTP frameworks, testing, actors, etc.</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/ModaOperandi/agora/blob/master/recommendations/details/scala.md"">Details</a></p>"
"Pulumi","Assess","Tools",FALSE,"<p>There is a recent trend to attempt to pull infrastructure-as-code (IaC) out of <a href=""https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html"">vendor</a>-<a href=""https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_intro.html#playbook-language-example"">specific</a> <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-anatomy.html"">DSLs</a> and into strongly-typed code libraries; <a href=""https://www.pulumi.com"">Pulumi</a> is perhaps the most advanced option within this space. The general idea is to reduce friction by bringing IaC to where the developers live, i.e. in the same language and with the same constructs (coding constructs, dependency management, importing libraries, etc) within they are accustomed to working.</p>

<p>This is an interesting space with some industry attention devoted to it and it might make sense to do some work to prove it out.</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/ModaOperandi/agora/blob/master/recommendations/details/pulumi.md"">Details</a></p>"
"Kotlin","Assess","Languages & Frameworks",FALSE,"<p>Kotlin is increasingly being considered as a viable language option for microservices. Moda Tech should keep an eye on it as a ""better Java"" if functional programming is not a priority. Moving Kotlin out of Assess would require a strong estimate of the level of investment to support it at the platform level.</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/ModaOperandi/agora/blob/master/recommendations/details/kotlin.md"">Details</a></p>"
"CloudFormation","Hold","Tools",FALSE,"<p>Being only AWS-specific and generally lagging behind new services and API improvements in AWS itself, there are other better options for infrastructure-as-code.</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/ModaOperandi/agora/blob/master/recommendations/details/cloudformation.md"">Details</a></p>"
"ReasonML","Hold","Languages & Frameworks",FALSE,"<p><a href=""https://reasonml.github.io/"">ReasonML</a> is an alternative syntax to <a href=""http://www.ocaml.org/"">OCaml</a> - a language that features functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming with a compiler that employs static typing and type inference. Though Moda Tech trialed ReasonML, we decided to deprecate its usage due to: steep learning curve, low internal knowledge, and lacking community support / documentation.</p>
