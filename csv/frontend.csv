"React","Adopt","Languages & Frameworks",FALSE,"<p>The most popular Frontend UI/component library currently in use, with a rich toolset and powerful set of suggested patterns based in functional composition and immutability.

Though Moda Tech trialed ReasonML, we decided to deprecate its usage due to: steep learning curve, low internal knowledge, and lacking community support / documentation.</p>
